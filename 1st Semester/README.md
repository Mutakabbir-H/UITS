# 🧩 1st Semester — Structured Programming Language (SPL) by C

This section of the repository contains all codes, lab exercises, and assignments completed during my **1st semester** at the **University of Information Technology & Sciences (UITS)**.  
Here, I began my journey into **Computer Science** through the fundamentals of **Structured Programming in C** — the foundation of logical thinking and software development.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a strong understanding of programming logic, control structures, data handling, and algorithmic problem solving using the **C programming language**.

---

## 📘 Key Topics Covered

- Basics of C Programming  
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Functions and Parameter Passing  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Pointers and Memory Management  
- File Handling in C  
- Mini Projects and Lab Assignments

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this semester, I achieved:
- A strong foundation in **structured programming**  
- Confidence in writing clean, logical, and optimized C code  
- The ability to break down problems into smaller, solvable parts  
- Preparedness for **advanced programming paradigms** like OOP and DSA

## 🏁 Reflection

> “Every variable I declared in this semester was more than code — it was a building block of logic, discipline, and the art of computational thinking.”
